                                            <h2>PC Gaming</h2>
                                            <p>
                                                PC Gaming has been one of my favourite hobbies since my early childhood. Thanks to gaming, I have developed great friendships all around the world, and I have also learned a lot about teamwork, strategy, and problem-solving. My favourite game which I have played for many years is <a href="https://www.valvesoftware.com/en/games/counterstrike" target="_blank">Counter-Strike</a>. Within recent years, this hobby combined with my interest in AI and cybersecurity has led me to explore the world of game hacking and anticheat development, an ever changing field that keeps me engaged and constantly learning.

                                            <h2>Guitar</h2>
                                            <p>
                                                I love playing guitar, especially metal and rock music. Some of my favourite bands are Green Day, Megadeth, and Death. It is a grueling but satisfying process to learn new song and I have enjoyed it since I began in late 2024.

                                                I have beem playing badminton casually for many years and I find it to be one of my favourite sports. It is a great way to stay active, improve my reflexes and also spend time with friends and family.
